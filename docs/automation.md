# Introduction
This document describes the overall automation strategy for the Quarkus superheroes services and how all the automation behind it works. There is a lot of automation and resource generation that happens "behind the scenes" when changes are pushed to the GitHub repo.

# GitHub action automation
There are 3 GitHub action workflows that run when code is pushed: [Basic building and testing](#basic-building-and-testing-workflow), [Build and push container images](#build-and-push-container-images-workflow), and [Create deploy resources](#create-deploy-resources-workflow).

## Basic building and testing workflow
The [Basic building and testing](../.github/workflows/simple-build-test.yml) workflow is a "sanity check". It is required to pass before pull requests can be merged.

It runs whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch as well as upon any pull requests.
   > The workflow can also be [triggered manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow).

It runs `./mvnw clean verify` and `./mvnw clean verify -Pnative` on the [`event-statistics`](../event-statistics), [`rest-fights`](../rest-fights), [`rest-heroes`](../rest-heroes), and [`rest-villains`](../rest-villains) applications on both Java 11 and 17.

## Build and push container images workflow
The [Build and push container images](../.github/workflows/build-push-container-images.yml) workflow does pretty much what it sounds like: builds and pushes container images. For JVM images and for the `ui-super-heroes` application, it builds both `amd64` and `arm64` images. Multi-arch native images are coming soon.

It only runs on pushes to the `main` branch after successful completion of the above [_Basic building and testing_](#basic-building-and-testing-workflow) workflow.
   > The workflow can also be [triggered manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow).

It consists of 7 jobs: 
- [_Build JVM container images_](#build-jvm-container-images-job)
- [_Build native container images_](#build-native-container-images-job)
- [_Build UI images_](#build-ui-images-job)
- [_Push application container images_](#push-application-container-images-job)
- [_Push UI images_](#push-ui-images-job)
- [Create application multi-arch manifests](#create-application-multi-arch-manifests)
- [Create UI multi-arch manifests](#create-ui-multi-arch-manifests)

If any step in any of the jobs fail then the entire workflow fails.

This image is a visual of what the workflow consists of:

![build-push-images-workflow](../images/build-push-container-images-workflow.png)

### Build JVM container images job
This job [Builds JVM container images](https://quarkus.io/guides/container-image#building) for the [`event-statistics`](../event-statistics), [`rest-fights`](../rest-fights), [`rest-heroes`](../rest-heroes), and [`rest-villains`](../rest-villains) applications on both Java 11 and 17 (both amd64 & arm64 platforms) using the [Docker Build action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action).

Each container image created has 4 tags:
- `{{app-version}}-quarkus-{{quarkus-version}}-java{{java-version}}-amd64`
- `{{app-version}}-quarkus-{{quarkus-version}}-java{{java-version}}-arm64`
- `java{{java-version}}-latest-amd64`
- `java{{java-version}}-latest-arm64`

> - Replace `{{app-version}}` with the application version (i.e. `1.0`).
> - Replace `{{quarkus-version}}` with Quarkus version the application uses (i.e. `2.9.2.Final`).
> - Replace `{{java-version}}` with the Java version the application was built with (i.e. `11` or `17`).

There are a total of 16 images built (4 applications x 2 JVM versions x 2 platforms).
      
### Build native container images job
This job runs in parallel with the [_Build JVM container images_](#build-jvm-container-images-job) and [_Build UI images_](#build-ui-images-job) jobs.

The job [Builds native executable container images](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#using-the-container-image-extensions) for the [`event-statistics`](../event-statistics), [`rest-fights`](../rest-fights), [`rest-heroes`](../rest-heroes), and [`rest-villains`](../rest-villains) applications on both Java 11 and 17 using [Mandrel](https://github.com/graalvm/mandrel).

Each container image created has 2 tags:
- `{{app-version}}-quarkus-{{quarkus-version}}-native-java{{java-version}}-amd64`
- `native-java{{java-version}}-latest-amd64`

> - Replace `{{app-version}}` with the application version (i.e. `1.0`).
> - Replace `{{quarkus-version}}` with Quarkus version the application uses (i.e. `2.9.2.Final`).
> - Replace `{{java-version}}` with the Java version the application was built with (i.e. `11` or `17`).

There are a total of 8 images built (4 applications x 2 JVM versions).

### Build UI images job
This job runs in parallel with the [_Build JVM container images_](#build-jvm-container-images-job) and [_Build native container images_](#build-native-container-images-job) jobs.

It builds the [`ui-super-heroes`](../ui-super-heroes) container image (both amd64 & arm64 platforms) with the following 4 tags:
- `{{app-version}}-amd64`
- `{{app-version}}-arm64`
- `latest-amd64`
- `latest-arm64`

> - Replace `{{app-version}}` with the application version (i.e. `1.0`).

There are a total of 2 images built, 1 each for amd64 & arm64 platforms.
      
### Push application container images job
Runs after successful completion of the [_Build JVM container image_](#build-jvm-container-images-job), [_Build native container image_](#build-native-container-images-job), and [_Build UI images_](#build-ui-images-job) jobs and in parallel with the [_Push UI images_](#push-ui-images-job) job.

All the container images created in the [_Build JVM container image_](#build-jvm-container-images-job) and [_Build native container image_](#build-native-container-images-job) jobs (24 total container images/48 tags) are pushed to https://quay.io/quarkus-super-heroes.

### Push UI images job
Runs after successful completion of the [_Build JVM container image_](#build-jvm-container-images-job), [_Build native container image_](#build-native-container-images-job), and [_Build UI images_](#build-ui-images-job) jobs and in parallel with the [_Push application container images_](#push-application-container-images-job) job.

All the container images created in the [_Build UI images_](#build-ui-images-job) job (2 total container images/4 tags) are pushed to https://quay.io/quarkus-super-heroes.

### Create application multi-arch manifests
Runs after successful completion of the [_Push application container images_](#push-application-container-images-job) job and in parallel with the [_Create UI multi-arch manifests_](#create-ui-multi-arch-manifests) job.

All the application container images for each platform (amd64 & arm64) are combined into manifest lists using the [`docker manifest`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest) command. For example, the `java{{java-version}}-latest-amd64` and `java{{java-version}}-latest-arm64` tags are combined into a single manifest list with the tag `java{{java-version}}-latest`.

### Create UI multi-arch manifests
Runs after successful completion of the [_Push UI images_](#push-ui-images-job) job and in parallel with the [_Create application multi-arch manifests_](#create-application-multi-arch-manifests) job.

All the UI container images for each platform (amd64 & arm64) are combined into manifest lists using the [`docker manifest`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest) command. For example, the `latest-amd64` and `latest-arm64` tags are combined into a single manifest list with the tag `latest`.

## Create deploy resources workflow
The [Create deploy resources](../.github/workflows/create-deploy-resources.yml) workflow is responsible for [generating all of the application resources](#application-resource-generation), described in a later section of this document.

It only runs on pushes to the `main` branch after successful completion of the [_Build and push container images_](#build-and-push-container-images-workflow) workflow.
   > The workflow can also be [triggered manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow).

All generated resources are subsequently pushed back into the repo by the action in a single commit.

## Cleanup artifacts
The cleanup artifacts job is responsible for cleaning up and deleting all artifacts produced by all the other jobs in the workflow. Many container images are created, stored, and shared amongst all the jobs. This could result in several gigabytes of storage used by each instance of the workflow.

This job will always run regardless of the status of the other jobs in the workflow. It uses the [`delete-run-artifacts` GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/delete-run-artifacts) to perform its work.

# Application resource generation
The resources and descriptors in the [root `deploy` directory](../deploy) as well as in each individual project's `deploy` directory ([`event-statistics`](../event-statistics/deploy), [`rest-fights`](../rest-fights/deploy), [`rest-heroes`](../rest-heroes/deploy), [`rest-villains`](../rest-villains/deploy), and [`ui-super-heroes`](../ui-super-heroes/deploy)) are used for deploying the entire system or subsets of it into various environments (i.e. Docker compose, OpenShift, Minikube, Kubernetes, etc).

Resources in these directories are generated by the [_Create deploy resources_ workflow](#create-deploy-resources-workflow) mentioned in the previous section. Any manual changes made to anything in any of those directories will be overwritten by the workflow upon its next execution.

## Kubernetes (and variants) resource generation
Kubernetes resources are generated into a `deploy/k8s` directory, either in the [project root directory](../deploy/k8s) or in each individual project's directory.

### Quarkus projects
Each Quarkus project ([`event-statistics`](../event-statistics), [`rest-fights`](../rest-fights), [`rest-heroes`](../rest-heroes), [`rest-villains`](../rest-villains)) uses the [Quarkus Kubernetes extension](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes) to generate Kubernetes and KNative manifests, the [Quarkus Minikube extension](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes#deploying-to-minikube) to generate Minikube manifests, and the [Quarkus OpenShift extension](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-openshift) to generate OpenShift manifests.

These extensions generate the manifests needed for the application itself but not for any other services. [These extensions can also incorporate additional resources](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes#using-existing-resources) by placing additional resources in each project's `src/main/kubernetes` directory.

The [`generate-k8s-resources.sh` script](../scripts/generate-k8s-resources.sh) loops through all versions of each application (Java versions 11 & 17, both JVM and native - 16 total versions) and merges the contents of files these extensions generate and places them into each project's `deploy/k8s` directory as well as the respective files in the [root `deploy/k8s` directory](../deploy/k8s).

The [`generate-k8s-resources.sh` script](../scripts/generate-k8s-resources.sh) additionally creates the Prometheus descriptors within the [root `deploy/k8s` directory](../deploy/k8s) for each Kubernetes variant platform.

In the [`rest-fights` project](../rest-fights), the [`generate-k8s-resources.sh` script](../scripts/generate-k8s-resources.sh) additionally copies in generated resources from the [`rest-heroes`](../rest-heroes) and [`rest-villains`](../rest-villains) projects into the `all-downstream.yml` files in the [`deploy/k8s` directory of the `rest-fights` project](../rest-fights/deploy/k8s).

### UI Project
Since the [`ui-super-heroes` project](../ui-super-heroes) isn't a Quarkus project it therefore doesn't have a way to generate the Kubernetes manifests.

The [`generate-k8s-resources.sh` script](../scripts/generate-k8s-resources.sh) implements the same pattern for this project. The [`ui-super-heroes` project](../ui-super-heroes) has a [`src/main/kubernetes` directory](../ui-super-heroes/src/main/kubernetes) containing the Kubernetes manifests.

The [`generate-k8s-resources.sh` script](../scripts/generate-k8s-resources.sh) merges the contents of these files into the files in the [`ui-super-heroes` project's `deploy/k8s` directory](../ui-super-heroes/deploy/k8s) as well as all the files in the [root `deploy/k8s` directory](../deploy/k8s).

## Docker compose resource generation
Docker compose resource generation follows a similar pattern as the [Kubernetes resource generation](#kubernetes-and-variants-resource-generation).

Docker compose resources are generated into a `deploy/docker-compose` directory, either in the [project root directory](../deploy/docker-compose) or in each individual project's directory.

### Quarkus projects
Each Quarkus project ([`event-statistics`](../event-statistics/src/main/docker-compose), [`rest-fights`](../rest-fights/src/main/docker-compose), [`rest-heroes`](../rest-heroes/src/main/docker-compose), [`rest-villains`](../rest-villains/src/main/docker-compose)) contains a `src/main/docker-compose` directory.

Inside this directory are a set of yaml files with a particular naming convention: `infra.yml`, `java{{java-version}}.yml`, and `native-java{{java-version}}.yml`. Each of these files contains what we are calling _Docker compose snippets_. These snippets aren't a complete Docker compose file on their own. Instead, they contain service definitions that will ultimately end up inside the `services` block in a Docker compose file.

This table describes the different files that can be found inside a project's `src/main/docker-compose` directory.

| File name                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `infra.yml`                       | Any infrastructure definitions that are needed by the application. Definitions in here a re-used for each version of the application (i.e. JVM 11, JVM 17, Native Java 11, Native Java 17).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `native-java{{java-version}}.yml` | Definition for the native image version of the application itself, built with a particular java version, denoted by `{{java-version}}`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The [`generate-docker-compose-resources.sh` script](../scripts/generate-docker-compose-resources.sh) loops through all versions of each application (Java versions 11 & 17, both JVM and native - 16 total versions) and merges contents of these files from each project's `src/main/docker-compose` directory into each project's `deploy/docker-compose` directory as well as the respective files in the [root `deploy/docker-compose` directory](../deploy/docker-compose).

The [`generate-docker-compose-resources.sh` script](../scripts/generate-docker-compose-resources.sh) additionally creates the [Prometheus compose file (`prometheus.yml`)](../deploy/docker-compose/prometheus.yml) within the [root `deploy/docker-compose` directory](../deploy/docker-compose).

### UI Project
Like the Quarkus projects, the [`ui-super-heroes` project](../ui-super-heroes) also has a [`src/main/docker-compose` directory](../ui-super-heroes/src/main/docker-compose). There is only a single [`app.yml` file](../ui-super-heroes/src/main/docker-compose/app.yml) containing the _Docker compose snippet_.

The [`generate-docker-compose-resources.sh` script](../scripts/generate-docker-compose-resources.sh) merges the contents of this file into the [`ui-super-heroes` project's `deploy/docker-compose/app.yml` file](../ui-super-heroes/deploy/docker-compose/app.yml) as well as all the files in the [root `deploy/docker-compose` directory](../deploy/docker-compose).
